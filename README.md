# Paper Investments

## Description

This flask web application incorporated with SQLite is a virtual trading simulator that allows users to register/login into an account. Starting with $10,000, the user can buy/sell and make financial decisions based on the real time stock market data provided by Yahoo Finance. There are many features like portfolio management, transaction history view and etc. I have also implemented password hashing and multiple backend mechanisms that will prevent SQL injection attacks and any adversaries from changing clientside information and affecting the intended backend functions.
